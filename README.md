# A Hat in Time: Crowd Control

This is a mod adds Crowd Control support for the cute-as-heck indie platformer, A Hat in Time. Crowd Control is a Twitch extension that allows Twitch chat to convert bits, subs and channel points to coins, in exchange for effects. Check out https://crowdcontrol.live/ for more info.  

In addition to this mod, you will also need the CC Twitch extension and CC desktop app. Take a look at our Twitch extension setup here:

IMPORTANT NOTE: There is currently a bug in the game itself, where the TCP feature in A Hat in Time no longer works as expected, meaning this mod cannot work on current versions of the game. You must use the steam console to downpatch to an older version of the game to use this mod. You can learn more on the steam page:
